# Estimating Membership Demand for Gyms using the Gravity Model

The gravity model is a commonly used method in spatial analysis and economics for estimating the demand for goods and services based on the attractiveness of different locations and the distance between those locations and potential consumers. This model is particularly useful for estimating the demand for gym memberships, as gym membership is often influenced by both the availability of facilities and the convenience of location.

In this project, we implement a gravity model to estimate the demand for gym memberships for a list of gyms based on the facilities and attractiveness of each gym, the local population count, and the distance between each gym and each local area.

## The Gravity Model
The gravity model is based on the principle that the demand for a product or service is proportional to the product of the attractiveness of the location and the population of the location, and inversely proportional to the distance between the location and the consumer. The basic equation for the gravity model is:

D_ij = A_i * P_j / d_ij^2

Where:

$D_{ij}$ is the demand for the product or service at location i by consumers at location j
$A_i$ is the attractiveness of location i
$P_j$ is the population of location j
$d_{ij}$ is the distance between location i and location j
In the context of gym memberships, we can use this equation to estimate the demand for memberships at each gym, based on the attractiveness of the gym, the population of each local area, and the distance between each gym and each local area.

## Implementation
We implement the gravity model using Python and the NumPy and Pandas libraries. The implementation includes two functions:

gravity_model_func(): This function implements the basic gravity model equation to estimate the demand for gym memberships based on the attractiveness of each gym, the distance between each gym and each local area, and the population count of each local area. If there are competing gyms in the area, the function also includes a competition factor to adjust the demand based on the attractiveness and distance of the competing gyms.

gravity_model(): This function uses the gravity_model_func() function to estimate the demand for gym memberships for a list of gyms based on the facilities and attractiveness of each gym, the local population count, and the distance between each gym and each local area. The function returns a DataFrame containing the demand for gym memberships for each gym.

## Using the Model
To use the gravity_model() function, you need to provide it with the following input data:

A DataFrame containing information about the gyms, including their name, attractiveness score, and location coordinates.
A DataFrame containing information about the local populations, including their population count and location coordinates.
(Optional) A DataFrame containing information about the competing gyms, including their attractiveness score and location coordinates.

    Here's an example of how to use the gravity_model() function:
    import pandas as pd
    from gravity_model import gravity_model

    # Load the gym and population data
    gym_data = pd.read_csv('gym_data.csv')
    population_data = pd.read_csv('population_data.csv')

    # Estimate the demand for gym memberships
    demand_data = gravity_model(gym_data, population_data)

    # Print the demand for each gym
    print(demand_data)

This would output a DataFrame containing the demand for gym memberships for each gym.

## Applications
The gravity model for estimating the demand for gym memberships can be used for a variety of applications, including:

1. Market analysis: Gym owners and investors can use the gravity model to identify potential locations for new gyms based on the demand for gym memberships in different local areas. This can help them make more informed decisions about where to invest their resources and which facilities to prioritize.

2. Competition analysis: The gravity model can be used to analyze the competitive landscape for gyms in a given area. By estimating the demand for gym memberships at each gym and considering the attractiveness and location of competing gyms, gym owners and investors can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their competitors and make strategic decisions about how to differentiate their own facilities.

3. Pricing strategy: The gravity model can help gym owners and investors set prices for memberships that reflect the demand for their facilities in different local areas. By understanding the factors that drive demand, such as the availability of facilities and the convenience of location, gym owners and investors can adjust their prices to maximize revenue while still remaining competitive in the market.

4. Public policy: The gravity model can be used by policymakers to identify areas with low access to fitness facilities and to make decisions about how to allocate public resources to promote fitness and wellness. By estimating the demand for gym memberships in different local areas, policymakers can target their interventions more effectively and improve the health outcomes of their constituents.

Overall, the gravity model provides a powerful tool for estimating the demand for gym memberships and understanding the factors that drive consumer behavior in the fitness industry. With its ability to account for both attractiveness and distance, the gravity model can help gym owners, investors, and policymakers make more informed decisions about where to invest resources and how to promote fitness and wellness in their communities.
